# H_matrix

Python + NumPy naive implementation of the Hierarchical matrics (H-matrics). To solve matrix equations in H-matrics format, LU-factorisation and matrix inversion are implemented. 

H_mat.py contains H_matrix class to work with H-matrices.
H_mat.ipynb contains examples of use, proof of correctness, and descriptions for them. It could be viewed through nbviewer by the link
